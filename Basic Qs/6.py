# Given an integer n, determine whether it is a palindrome number or not. 
# A number is called a palindrome if it reads the same from forward and backward.

# Examples:
# Input: n = 12321
# Output: True
# Explanation: 12321 is a palindrome number because it reads same  forward and backward.
# Input: n = 1234
# Output:  False
# Explanation: 1234 is not a palindrome number because it does not read the same forward and backward.

n= "12321"
p= str(n)
b= "".join(reversed(p))
print("", b)

if n==b:
    print("TRUE")
else:
    print("FALSE")
